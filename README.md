# Tom-s-Adventure

Platformer type game based around a character named Tom. Tom uses his Rocket Launcher to perform jumps, solve puzzles,
and defeat enemies! 

### Plans
* Establish game mechanics (such as ladders, deathzones, tweaking physics)
* Create a structure for the game so that it can be easily added-on and modified
  (easy way to create new levels, and add new enemies)
* Fix everything that is broken
* Draw and create textures
* Create levels
